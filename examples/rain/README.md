# Rain in cities

Check whether it's raining in given cities!

## Requirements

You'll need an API key from [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org/).

Paste this key into the `KEY` variable in the Python file.

You'll also need to download the `cities.json` file:

```bash
wget xxx
```

Just edit the names of cities to the ones you want to monitor.
